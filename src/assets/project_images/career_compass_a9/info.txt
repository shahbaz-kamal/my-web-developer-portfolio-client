Struggles: 
I struggled with implementing Firebase authentication because it was a new concept for me. Understanding the integration of Firebase services, handling authentication methods like email/password or third-party logins, and setting up the necessary configurations was challenging at first. However, once I got familiar with the Firebase SDK and its documentation, I was able to overcome the obstacles and successfully implement secure user authentication in the application.

Lackings: 
The project lacks essential features like CRUD operations for managing data (e.g., users, products, orders), JWT (JSON Web Token) implementation for secure authentication and authorization, and a payment gateway for processing transactions. These components are crucial for building a complete, secure, and functional web application.
